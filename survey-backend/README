To access the server: start a terminal in the survey-backend folder and run 'npm run devStart'
The server will be started up on localhost:5000

There are two endpoints: /sets and /questions

/sets:
GET will return all sets currently in the database
GET/:id will return the set with the specific id passed
POST will make a new set (id is created by the db, so just pass a JSON object with title and a questions array)
PUT/:id will replace a set's information (must pass an object with id, title, and questions array)
PATCH/:id will replace specific parts of a set's information - if you pass a JSON object with just a title, the id and questions array will not change
DELETE/:id deletes the set with the id passed

/questions: 
GET will return all questions currently in the database
GET/:id will return the question with the specific id passed
POST will make a new question (pass a JSON object with title, question type, and an options array if multiple choice or checkbox)

Look in Admin.jsx and AdminSet.jsx for examples
